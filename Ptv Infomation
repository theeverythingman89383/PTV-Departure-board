{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"version":"v3","title":"PTV Timetable API - Version 3","description":"The PTV Timetable API provides direct access to Public Transport Victoria's public transport timetable data.\r\n\r\nThe API returns scheduled timetable, route and stop data for all metropolitan and regional train, tram and bus services in Victoria, including Night Network(Night Train and Night Tram data are included in metropolitan train and tram services data, respectively, whereas Night Bus is a separate route type).\r\n\r\nThe API also returns real-time data for metropolitan train, tram and bus services (where this data is made available to PTV), as well as disruption information, stop facility information, and access to myki ticket outlet data.\r\n\r\nThis Swagger is for Version 3 of the PTV Timetable API. By using this documentation you agree to comply with the licence and terms of service.\r\n\r\nTrain timetable data is updated daily, while the remaining data is updated weekly, taking into account any planned timetable changes (for example, due to holidays or planned disruptions). The PTV timetable API is the same API used by PTV for its apps. To access the most up to date data PTV has (including real-time data) you must use the API dynamically.\r\n\r\nYou can access the PTV Timetable API through a HTTP or HTTPS interface, as follows:\r\n\r\n    base URL / version number / API name / query string\r\nThe base URL is either:\r\n  *  http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au\r\nor\r\n  *  https://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au\r\n\r\nThe Swagger JSON file is available at http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/docs/v3\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions are available on the PTV website at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/apifaq\r\n\r\nLinks to the following information are also provided on the PTV website at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ptv-timetable-api/\r\n* How to register for an API key and calculate a signature\r\n* PTV Timetable API V2 to V3 Migration Guide\r\n* PTV Timetable API Data Quality Statement\r\n\r\nAll information about how to use the API is in this documentation. PTV cannot provide technical support for the API.\r\n","termsOfService":"See http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ptv-timetable-api/","contact":{"name":"Public Transport Victoria","url":"http://ptv.vic.gov.au/digital"},"license":{"name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}},"host":"timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au","schemes":["https","http"],"paths":{"/v3/departures/route_type/{route_type}/stop/{stop_id}":{"get":{"tags":["Departures"],"summary":"View departures for all routes from a stop","operationId":"Departures_GetForStop","consumes":[],"produces":["application/json","text/json","text/html"],"parameters":[{"name":"route_type","in":"path","description":"Number identifying transport mode; values returned via RouteTypes API","required":true,"type":"integer","format":"int32","enum":[0,1,2,3,4]},{"name":"stop_id","in":"path","description":"Identifier of stop; values returned by Stops API","required":true,"type":"integer","format":"int32"},{"name":"platform_numbers","in":"query","description":"Filter by platform number at stop","required":false,"type":"array","items":{"type":"integer","format":"int32"},"collectionFormat":"multi"},{"name":"direction_id","in":"query","description":"Filter by identifier of direction of travel; values returned by Directions API - /v3/directions/route/{route_id}","required":false,"type":"integer","format":"int32"},{"name":"gtfs","in":"query","description":"Indicates that stop_id parameter will accept \"GTFS stop_id\" data","required":false,"type":"boolean"},{"name":"include_advertised_interchange","in":"query","description":"Indicates whether data related to interchanges should be included in the response (default = false)\r\nWhen set to true, this parameter enables API clients to retrieve additional exchange information (stops, routes, runs, directions and disruptions) in a single call instead of making multiple requests","required":false,"type":"boolean"},{"name":"date_utc","in":"query","description":"Filter by the date and time of the request (ISO 8601 UTC format) (default = current date and time)","required":false,"type":"string","format":"date-time"},{"name":"max_results","in":"query","description":"Maximum number of results returned","required":false,"type":"integer","format":"int32"},{"name":"include_cancelled","in":"query","description":"Indicates if cancelled services (if they exist) are returned (default = false) - metropolitan train only","required":false,"type":"boolean"},{"name":"look_backwards","in":"query","description":"Indicates if filtering runs (and their departures) to those that arrive at destination before date_utc (default = false).
